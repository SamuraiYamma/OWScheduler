How this works:
Any bugs is entered here as request. Please utilize a number system, making your number request x+1,
x being the last number in the list. This is to help assign tasks when needed. Format is as follows:

T0D0: [x] description of problem - filename.
(pro tip: use words like Fix, Add, Change, Remove, at the start of each request to make it easier to read)

This log system should make error checking UI much easier. The log should keep the most recent additions
on top.
